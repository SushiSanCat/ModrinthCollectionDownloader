A modern Python script to **automatically download and update mods** from a [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com) collection, tailored to your chosen Minecraft version and mod loader (e.g., Fabric, Forge, Quilt).

This script streamlines the management of large modpacks by fetching mods directly via Modrinth's API and organizing them locally.

## üì¶ Requirements

- Python 3.10 or newer
- Internet connection
- Modrinth Collection ID

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

1. Download `modrinth_collection_downloader.py`.
2. Open the file `modrinth_collection_downloader.py` as text editor
3. Modify the Minecraft version, loader, and collection ID to your desired options.
4. Open a terminal and navigate to the script's directory.
5. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python modrinth_collection_downloader.py
   ```
6. The script will download all mods from the specified Modrinth collection. Downloaded mods will be saved in a folder located alongside `modrinth_collection_downloader.py`.

### üí° Example Configuration

## üí° Best Usage for this Python Script

For the most seamless experience, you can place `modrinth_collection_downloader.py` directly into your Minecraft directory folder, typically located at:

```
C:\Users\YOURNAME\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\
```

**Why do this?**
- Whenever you run the script from this location, it will automatically download and update your mods right where Minecraft expects them.
- The script will also delete old versions of mods to prevent conflicts, so you don't have to manually update or clean up mods one by one!
- This keeps your mod folder always up-to-date with your chosen Modrinth collection.

**Tip:** Replace `YOURNAME` with your actual Windows username.

## üìñ Example

```bash
python modrinth_collection_downloader.py --version 1.21.6 --loader fabric --collection HO2OnfaY
```
